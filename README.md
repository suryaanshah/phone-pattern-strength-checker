# phone-pattern-strength-checker
Is your phone's security pattern really secure? This program checks it by comparing it to a large list of commonly known patterns.

# Steps
1. You give it your pattern (the program is completely offline so dw you aren't sharing your pattern with me :P).
2. It matches it with commonly known patterns to check the strength of it.
3. Currently it gives binary response i.e. if your pattern is weak (0) or strong (1).
4. If your pattern is weak then you should probably change it to something strong.
